Miscellaneous Notes
===================

* Add capability to generate a 'random' image (that is, one
  of those compound expression)
    * What does the client specify?  Probability of each
      function?  Size?  Etc?
* Add evolutionary capabilities.
* Cuong suggested that we need to consider how much data people are
  storing.  (Since they can't store actual images, I'm hoping that
  won't be too much.)
* We need a way to backup the database regularly.
