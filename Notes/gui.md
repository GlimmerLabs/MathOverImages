Notes on the Graphical User Interface
=====================================

* Note that there are benefits to making a series of pictures (either
  by hand or by computer) that show a typical "use case".
* Do we have thumbnails for every operation, or just when the user
  specifies them?
* When users want to specify their own new function, how do they
  indicate which things are inputs to the function and which are
  parts of the function?  
    * That is, when someone makes a complex image by combining
      operations, that complex image is effectively a function of
      some of the base inputs, and should be storable as such so
      that you can easily switch inputs.
    * Areas of the screen might help.
* How do we show user-defined functions in the "functions" area?
* How do we deal with n-ary functions (functions that can change their
  number of parameters, such as average, sum, or product)?
    * One option: Each of these always has one open 'slot' that you
      can connect to.
* We'll need to check for cycles when people draw these diagrams.
* How does someone *change* the function at one point in the 
  diagram?
