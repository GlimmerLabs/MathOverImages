Notes for developers
====================

Files not in repo
-----------------

The certs directory and functions/auth.js are intentionally NOT in
the repo because they store confidential information.  You should 
manually link to the versions on the main server.  In our standard
setup, that's something like

	$ cd MathOverImages
        $ cd Site
        $ ln -s /home/glimmer/MathOverImages/Site/certs
        $ cd functions
        $ ln -s /home/glimmer/MathOverImages/Site/functions/auth.js
