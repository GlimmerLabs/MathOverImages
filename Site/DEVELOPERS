Notes for developers
====================

These are rough notes for the folks who are developing MIST on things to
do for setting up and running the server.

One-Time Setup
--------------

### Load Express and other libraries

	$ npm install

### Add files not in repo

The certs directory and functions/auth.js are intentionally NOT in
the repo because they store confidential information.  You should 
manually link to the versions on the main server.  In our standard
setup, that's something like

	$ cd MathOverImages
        $ cd Site
        $ ln -s /home/mist/MathOverImages/Site/certs
        $ cd functions
        $ ln -s /home/mist/MathOverImages/Site/functions/auth.js

The file functions/ports.js is also not in the repository.  In this case,
it's so that we can each set up our own ports without having to deal
with git complaining that server.js has changed.

	$ cd MathOverImages
	$ cd Site
	$ cd functions
	$ cp /home/mist/MathOverImages/Site/functions/ports.js .

Then edit ports.js to use your own ports.

Running the Server
------------------

Test mode

        $ nodemon server.js

Normal mode

        $ nohup node server.js
