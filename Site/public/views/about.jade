            p.
              MIST (the Mathematical Image Synthesizing Toolkit) isnâ€™t
              just about the pretty pictures. By using the MIST
              application, it is our intention that users will
              explore functional problem solving and computational
              thinking by creating non-representational images.
              Computational thinking is an essential part of computer
              science, and MIST allows anyone to develop this skill.
              Anyone can use MIST because it does not require any
              prior experience in computer science. Users have the
              option of creating images from scratch, or completing
              tutorials and challenges that encourage problem solving
              and computational thinking through image building.
              MIST also encourages interactions between users.
              Create an account to see, share, and modify the work
              of other users. Our goal is to develop a community
              where users enjoy learning computational thinking by
              associating mathematical functions with interesting
              images.
