  p.
    As you can see, there are a variety of functions available (and more are coming
    soon).  Some functions, like <code>sin</code>, accept a fixed number of inputs.
    Others, like <code>sum</code> and <code>mult</code>, accept variable numbers of
    inputs.
  p. 
    Right now, values are showing, so we must click the "add a function" tab to see
    the available functions.
  p.
    To add a function to the workspace, drag it down from the menu to where you want
    it, just like you add a value.
