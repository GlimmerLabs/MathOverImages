Welcome to Mist! This tutorial will help you navigate the website with more ease.  So here we are at the MIST homepage.  It's important to note that you can access different pages at all times from the top of website, especially for logging in and getting extra tutorials right at the "help" link. 

As you can see, we have options for "creating", going on "tutorial", and the "gallery".  For now, we will take a look at the about page. (*click into about*) 

The about page explains what exactly what the purpose of our graphical application is, and even includes some contact information.  Well, I've already read it.  Let's look at more stuff. 

Now, we will go straight into the gallery. 

________________________(*click into gallery*)

What you should see are 9 images.  When you hover over the different images some of them might move.  It's important to note that the images that don't move are simply static. 

Up at the right corner, you should see 4 tabs.  When you click on random again, a different set of images come up.  Neat.

When clicking on the recent tab, you can access the latest images made on the site.  Want to see more super cool images?  Click on next button to view older images!

Are you a huge fan of one of these images? (*choose one*) This one happens to be my favorite currently.  (*click into image*) Feel free to click on any image to go to it's individual page.

On the single image page, you can view the title, the date it was made, who made it, the function written out below, and the comments below.  I'm a huge fan of this particular image, so I think I want to vote it up.  (*try clicking the star*)  It looks like I cannot vote by clicking the star, but if I log in, I can comment and vote up.  (*log in, vote up, make a clever comment*)  If you do not have an account, you can sign up for an account via the link below. 

Okay, now I voted up the image and made a comment. 

Going back to the gallery (*use the header*), if I clicked the top rated tab, I can see the most voted images on the site. Again, if I want to view more images with lower votes, I can click the "next" button.    

The feature tab includes some images that administration has chosen for their own liking. Typical.

Okay, going back to home...

I bet you want to make some of these super cool images!  If you're looking at this video, I assume you're new the website.  I would recommend checking out our "Create workspace" tutorial located right in the tutorial section! You can also access our various tutorials via the help page in the header from anywhere on the site. (*click on help page*)

To create your own fantastic images, you can enter the create workspace through the home page, OR, through the header. (*click on create in header*)

After creating and saving some breathtaking images, you can look at them again in the recent section of the gallery OR your own albums in your account. I would highly recommend you make an account!

(*click on your own account from header)

This is my bio page that shows my user name, the date I joined the site, my chosen user image and a small blurb about myself. Since this is my account and not someone else's, I can edit my bio by clicking on the edit button that looks like a tiny pencil. (*mouse over edit blurb*).  You can also change your featured image by (WILL COME LATER)

I can also change other parts of my account in the account settings section (*click on account settings*)

I have the ability to change my user name, my password and my email.

(*click on account in header again*)

Going back to my account... i can also check out those albums i mentioned before (*click on albums*).

I can create a new album with the create album button or view all of my images in order from newest to oldest.

Currently in the works is our challenges section seen up in the header next to the create link. It will allow users to not only complete challenges and earn badges, but also create their own challenges for others to complete. The challenges made along with the badges earned will be viewed in users' accounts (*mouse over badges and challenges tabs*).

And that about wraps up navigating our wonderful MIST website, I'll just log out here... (*log out) thanks for watching!
